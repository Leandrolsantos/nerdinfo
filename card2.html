                    <p>Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published 
                        by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed 
                        by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack 
                        Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963, 
                        and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his 
                        creation, Iron Man was a founding member of a superhero team, the Avengers, 
                        with Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and 
                        with the Avengers, have been published consistently since the character's 
                        creation.</p>
