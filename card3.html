                        published by DC Comics. The character was created by artist Bob 
                        Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the 
                        comic book Detective Comics on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe 
                        continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American
